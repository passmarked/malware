The tested page is suspected as a phishing page by either [Safe Browsing](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/) or [Phishtank](https://www.phishtank.com/).

This page may be a forgery or imitation of another website, designed to trick users into sharing personal or financial information. Entering any personal information on this page may result in identity theft or other abuse. You can find out more about phishing from www.antiphishing.org.

This occurs as a result of URL's on your website. Three checks are done to establish this:

* If the page itself is flagged.
* If URL's flagged on external sites.
* If URL's flagged on your site you are linking to.

# How do I fix this ?

* Backup regularly.
* Keep all software updated.
* Consider using SSH or SFTP instead of FTP.
* Consider using a website monitoring service.
* Use secure computers when accessing your site.
* Use appropriate file permissions on your web server.
* Clean up your site, removing all malicious code/files.
* Use caution when deciding which third party scripts and plugins to install.
* Remove any scripts, plugins, or other software that you are no longer using.

When you have secured/cleaned your site from malicious code, you need to request a review of the affected URL's. There are a few ways to do this:

* Requesting a review by [stopbadware](https://www.stopbadware.org/request-review)
* Report it to [Google Safe Browsing](https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/)
* Using [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en), which is the fastest way.
