# How do I fix this ?

Common ways to find malicious activity:

**Malicious scripts**

>Attackers will often inject scripts into the content of your web pages, `<script src="http://www.google-anaiytics.com/urchin,js"></script`, note the spelling. Other files like images and PDF's aren't safe from this attack either. Attackers may also use obfuscation to make it more difficult for antivirus software to detect.

**.htaccess redirects**

>Many hosting providers use the Apache web server, which uses a hidden server file called .htaccess. Attackers will sometimes modify this file to redirect users to harmful websites.

**Hidden iframes**

>An iframe is a section of a web page that loads content from another web site or page. Attackers will often use this method to inject malicious iframes into a web page. These iframes will be configured to not show on the web page, but still load it's content.

There are a few recommendations before cleaning up your site:

* Change all passwords related to your site.
* Make sure all the software used is up-to-date.
* Use reputable antivirus software to scan your development machine.
* Take your site offline to protect your visitors from any malicious activity.

Securing your site:

* Backup regularly.
* Use a file viewer.
* Keep all software updated.
* Use free/paid website scanning services.
* Consider using SSH or SFTP instead of FTP.
* Consider using a website monitoring service.
* Use secure computers when accessing your site.
* Use appropriate file permissions on your web server.
* Clean up your site, removing all malicious code/files.
* Use caution when deciding which third party scripts and plugins to install.
* Remove any scripts, plugins, or other software that you are no longer using.

When you have secured/cleaned your site from malicious code, you need to request a review of the affected URL's. There are a few ways to do this:

* Requesting a review by [stopbadware](https://www.stopbadware.org/request-review)
* Report it to [Google Safe Browsing](https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/)
* Using [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en), which is the fastest way.
